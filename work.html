        <h2>Nurseboard</h2>
        <p>
          My final year project focuses on developing a mobile application for
          independent nurses, aiming to simplify patient management within their
          teams. In this project, I took full responsibility for the frontend
          interface development, using React Native technology. <br />
          <br />The backend, on the other hand, was developed in Java with
          Spring Boot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, my role was to design an intuitive and functional user
          interface while ensuring seamless integration with the backend
          functionalities to provide a smooth and consistent user experience.
